In this post, I wouldlike to share my GSoC 2019 community bonding experiencewith CCExtractor Development, work-progress and the roadahead.       Community Bonding Period: The official list of selected proposals was released by Google on the 6th of May and with it started the community bonding period. It began with me jumping for joy after getting the news of my proposal getting selected. It was basically a month full of learning and planning. Two social groups have been created, one on Facebook and the other on Telegram, which includes over 600 selected students from around the globe. It is a great platform for sharing your progress and getting help when you are stuck somewhere. Here are the tasks I checked off during the community period!    Deciding the structure of my projectThis is the first time I am going to be working on a project which involves so much! Deciding the structure of the projectearly was a crucial task so that the development stayssmooth ahead. I was sure to use C++ as the languageand thus I started off with strengthening the conceptsof the language. After checking out some popular C++projects and reading some blogs on the same I havedecided to use something like this:     Creating a Trello boardAs I had mentioned in my proposal I wanted to have adetailed checklist of the tasks to be done with their deadlines. This would help me and my mentor to keep track of my work. I am maintaining the milestones and deliverables in a Trello board, which can be found here¬†:  Milestones and checklist for co-oCCur: High-speed subtitle synchronization tool      Setting-up my BlogFor everyone to follow my progress on the project I have set up this blog. This is the best way for the whole communityto know what‚Äôs cooking. It‚Äôs a simple and mediumish themed Jekyll blog hosted onGithub pages.  Here it resides: https://sypai. github. io     Setting-up Payoneer accountThere have been more discussions on this in the Telegram group than anything else. Fortunately, it took me around ten minutes to set it up and receive the confirmation email fromPayoneer. ¬†   Surprise &#127873; &#128217; : As mentioned in the CCExtractor‚Äôs website, This year we're going to try something new. All accepted students will get a programming book immediately after being accepted, with the hope that they read them before the coding starts. We want to see if this increases the quality of the work. Each of the accepted students was to choose a technical book of their choice. I chose Elements of Programming Interviews in Python by Adnan Aziz, Tsung-Hsien Lee and Amit Prakash. Placement season being next in the queue, this book is a very good addition to my library.  Thank you CCExtractor Development! üòç   Bad News &#128531;: My end semester exams have been postponed, this was known, I had mentioned this in my proposal. But the final schedule wasn‚Äôt announced until 20th May. Guess what! Exams started from the very same day the coding period officially began. ¬† I had to re-schedule the weekly milestones and deadlines. I have informed my mentor regarding this and he says, as long as you are on track by the time of the first evaluation you're OK. But it would be a good idea to show me your progress often. It would be a bit of a predicament to manage to work with the exams. I hope by the end of first evaluation, I will able to complete all the deliverables.  Road Ahead! &#128739; : At the end of the first four weeks, first evaluation [24 May - 28 May] begins. I will try to stick to the deadlines as I have mentioned in the  trello  board. I know it is going to be a roller-coaster ride. I am sure I will learn a lot during the next 3 months! I wish all the participants a fun and a productive summer. Happy Coding! "

    "body": "2019/05/19 - My proposal co-oCCur: High-speed subtitle synchronization has been accepted by CCExtractor Development for Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2019!  I am thrilled to bits to spend my summer working with the ‚Äúmagicians‚Äù behind the de-facto subtitle tool - CCExtractor. My mentor is Carlos Fernandez Sans (org admin, who originally built CCExtractor). What more could one ask for?       About GSoC:     Simply put, it is an international annual program by Google aimed at promoting Open Source Software development among college and university students. Students apply for a project/idea of their choice to one of the many Open Source Organizationsselected by Google, by submitting a proposal. Selected students spend their summer building the project by implementing what they proposed. In return, the students gain excellent experience of building a real-world project, mentored by seasoned developers. The stipend üí∞ and of course the bragging rights! üòé       About my project:     Out of the many ideas, present in the CCExtractor‚Äôs GSoC page, I gravitated to Writing high-Speed subtitle synchronization tool. After about a month of research on the same, I submitted my proposal on the 9th of April. Here is my accepted proposal! Closed Captions (CC) and subtitles enhance audiovisual content by providing speech information and description of representative events in a textual format.  Captioning is especially used as an aid for people with hearing loss or deafness, but its use is definitely not limited to that domain.  For instance, it is frequently the case that captions are necessary to watch a TV show in a noisy surrounding or when one is not familiar with the language or accent available in the audio streams.  Downloading a subtitle document and playing it alongside an episode of your favourite TV show, is not rocket science, but it sure can feel that way sometimes. Getting the subtitle document that gives satisfactory synchronization on the first attempt is like hitting the jackpot. I know the annoyance that comes in with misaligned subtitles and is a very general problem.  For an ideal subtitle file, the subtitles are perfectly aligned with the base audiovisual content. In other words, the audio and the corresponding subtitles co-oCCur. The misalignment of the subtitle files is the underlying problem that this project aims to solve so that the viewer does not have any burden before the fun starts (this is what matters).  For the next 3 months, I will be working on this amazing project. I hope by the end of this summer the tool is ready to be used!  Every skill you acquire, doubles your odds of success Scott Adams"
