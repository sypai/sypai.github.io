My proposal co-oCCur: High-speed subtitle synchronization has been accepted by CCExtractor Development
 for Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2019! I am thrilled to bits to spend my summer working with the “magicians” 
 behind the de-facto subtitle tool - CCExtractor.
 My mentor is Carlos Fernandez Sans (org admin, who originally built CCExtractor). What more could one ask for?

First things first:

What is Google Summer of code?
Simply put, it is an international annual program by Google aimed at promoting Open Source Software development among college and university students. Students apply for a project/idea of their choice to one of the many Open Source Organizations selected by Google by submitting a proposal. Selected students spend their summer building the project by implementing what they proposed.

In return, the students gain excellent experience of building a real-world project mentored by seasoned developers, the stipend <money> and of course the bragging rights! <brag>

What is the project that I am working on?
Out of the many ideas, present in the CCExtractor’s GSoC page, I gravitated to Writing High-Speed synchronization tool. After a month of research on the same, I submitted my proposal on the 9th of April. Here is my proposal!
